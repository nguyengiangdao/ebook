  AbstractThis paper develops a pairs trading strategy via unsupervised learning. Unlike conventional pairstrading strategies that identify pairs based on return time series, we identify pairs by incorporatingﬁrm characteristics as well as price information. Firm characteristics are revealed to provide im-portant information for pair identiﬁcation and signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the pairstrading strategy. Applied to the US stock market from January 1980 to December 2020, thelong-short portfolio constructed via the agglomerative clustering earns a statistically signiﬁcantannualized mean return of 24.8% and a Sharpe ratio of 2.69. The strategy remains proﬁtable afteraccounting for transaction costs and removing stocks below 20% NYSE-size quantile. A host ofrobustness tests conﬁrm that the results are not driven by data snoopin
